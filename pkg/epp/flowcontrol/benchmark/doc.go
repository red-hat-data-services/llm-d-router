// Package benchmark load-tests the Flow Control layer. It contains two families of benchmarks that
// trade off isolation against realism.
//
// # Throughput microbenchmarks (mock detector)
//
// PerformanceMatrix, TopologyChurn, and MassCancellation isolate the FlowController's CPU cost
// using a mock SaturationDetector and a synchronous, sleep-free pipeline. Simulating downstream
// inference latency with sleeps would park goroutines and measure Go scheduler overhead rather
// than computational throughput, so the harness avoids it:
//
//  1. Intentional Backpressure (W > L): Ingress Concurrency (W) is driven higher than the Capacity
//     Limit (L), forcing requests to queue.
//  2. Strict Capacity Checking: the mock SaturationDetector atomically grants capacity only when
//     evaluated, preventing races where dispatch outruns clients.
//  3. Immediate Draining: when a client unblocks it immediately frees its capacity slot, triggering
//     the next dispatch and keeping the system active.
//  4. Consistent Queue Depth: a fixed, deep queue forces continuous evaluation of fairness and
//     ordering policies at limits, isolating CPU performance.
//
// # Full-path benchmark (real components)
//
// FullPath measures the complete data path with the REAL InFlightLoadProducer and concurrency
// SaturationDetector wired into the FlowController, capturing the cost of the detector's
// per-dispatch DynamicAttribute reads against live producer state. It complements the
// microbenchmarks: they isolate flow-control CPU; it prices realistic saturation detection.
// Producer-level leak correctness is covered by the inflightload producer's own unit tests, not
// here.
//
// # Interpreting Metrics in b.RunParallel
//
// In a highly concurrent queuing system, standard Go benchmark metrics require care to interpret:
//
//  1. ns/op (system-wide amortized time): because these use b.RunParallel, ns/op represents inverse
//     throughput, not latency. The d/s custom metric converts it to dispatches per second.
//  2. ops: one "op" is the complete lifecycle of a single simulated request: ingress, queuing,
//     policy evaluation, and egress.
//  3. allocs/op and B/op (GC pressure): high allocations per request mean the garbage collector
//     thrashes under load, causing latency jitter.
//  4. Saturated Coordinates (W > L): when Concurrency exceeds Capacity, EnqueueAndWait blocks;
//     because capacity is released immediately upon dispatch, an "op" is governed by the Flow
//     Control layer's CPU overhead.
//
// # Custom Metrics Reported
//
//   - d/s:       (Dispatches/sec) the primary throughput metric (PerformanceMatrix, TopologyChurn,
//     FullPath).
//   - r/s:       (Rejects/sec) rate of requests rejected due to capacity or timeouts.
//   - errors:    total unexpected runtime errors encountered.
//   - zombies/s: rate of requests hitting context deadlines/TTLs (MassCancellation).
