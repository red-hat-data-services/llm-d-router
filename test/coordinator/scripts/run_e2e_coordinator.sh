# trap deletes the e2e-coordinator-tests cluster on Ctrl-C. The delete is
# unconditional and only meaningful when the suite created that cluster

# unless a cluster of that name happens to exist.

# Every spec deploys its own encode/prefill/decode workers and coordinator, and
# each group adds its own namespace and Envoy, so 50m leaves headroom over the
# shared 45m default. It stays under the e2e-tests job cap in
# .github/workflows/ci-coordinator.yaml (timeout-minutes: 60), so a slow run hits
# the ginkgo timeout first and still dumps logs and tears down the kind cluster.
